<h2>Hello</h2>
<p>
    This is an old version of my Chrome's New Tab/Home page which was serving me as a websites </i>launcher</i> and basic<i>personal wiki</i>. Cards section's style and behaviour was inspired by the early Material Design design language. During project development I learned about:
    <ul>
        <li>operations on cookies<span> for overriding site's light/dark mode which is based on the daytime</span></li>
        <li>using components for building website<span> - for the sake of the github demo page I replaced PHP's <codeblock>include</codeblock> expressions with jQuery insertions</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

</p> 
<style>
    span { opacity: .7 }
</style>
