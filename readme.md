<h2>Hello</h2>
<p>
    This is an old version of my Chrome's New Tab/Home page which was serving me as a websites </i>launcher</i> and basic <i>personal wiki</i>. Cards section's style and behaviour was inspired by the early Material Design design language, but in some aspect I adopted quite new at that time Material Theme guidelines.
    <br />
    During project development I was learning about:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>UI/UX principles<span style="opacity: .7"> based on the Material Design</span></li>
    <li>DOM manipulation using the jQuery library</li>
    <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
    <li>component-based website building<span style="opacity: .7"> - for the sake of the github demo page I replaced PHP's <code>include</code> expressions with jQuery insertions</li>
    <li>operations on cookies<span style="opacity: .7"> for overriding site's light/dark mode which is based on the daytime</span></li>
</ul>

    Project publication was an excercise in familiarizing myself with Git environment.
